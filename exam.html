<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shane Hendrickson, and I’m a student at Georgia College & State University. I’m passionate about both my studies and my personal growth. Being at Georgia College has given me the opportunity to connect with new people, explore various interests, and embrace the vibrant campus life. I enjoy immersing myself in different experiences that help me grow both academically and personally.</p>
<p>Outside of the classroom, I love spending time outdoors and staying active. I’m a big fan of ultimate frisbee, swimming, and disc golf—each of these activities lets me challenge myself physically while having a great time with friends. Whether it's the fast pace of ultimate frisbee or the precision of disc golf, I appreciate the mix of strategy and fun that these sports bring.</p>
<p>Balancing my academic responsibilities with my love for sports and outdoor activities keeps me energized and focused. It’s important for me to maintain an active lifestyle, and being at Georgia College allows me to do just that. I’m excited about what the future holds and how I can continue growing in all aspects of my life.</p>
